The toy story 2 editor

Note for those who dare enter:
The code within is largely for implementation purposes and will be beautified throughout time

Currently T2T can:
- Load & Save .SAV Files, potentially some spooky issues may occur
- Load .NGN files, spooky issues are likely to occur

With regards to NGN support, several things need reanalysis within the NGN format
Main sections include:
- Character animations
- "Shape Links" something at the end of the file
- Misc Shape data/Material data

Plus, there are some unknown values still not known within the save editor.
